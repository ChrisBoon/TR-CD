# Instructions

## On a new machine

### You need Ruby

You need Ruby so recommend OSX, Linux or Windows 10.

### Gems

The gems used in this project are Sass, Compass, Jekyll and Wdm. If you don't have already installed them, type each of these commands in the terminal (anywhere):

`gem install sass` 

`gem install compass` 

`gem install wdm`

`gem install jekyll`  

`gem install jekyll-paginate` 

### You need node.js

I suggest you use Homebrew on Mac:
- Install Homebrew
- then on the command line run 'brew install node'.

### You need Grunt
Once node.js is installed, you can install Grunt CLI globally - on the command line run 'npm install -g grunt-cli'

### You need Git (probably)
We should be keeping these in a Repository so you probably want Git. If you already know how to use it from the command line go ahead.
Personally I recommend using a GUI. https://www.git-tower.com/ for Mac is great. For Windows you can go with https://desktop.github.com/ as long as we still use GitHub for hosting repos.


## Setting up the project
Clone the repository , open the terminal, 'cd' into the root folder for the project, and type:

`npm install`

this will take care of all the dependencies.

When that's done, whilst still in the root of this project's folder, type `jekyll serve`, open another Terminal window and type `grunt`

The project will now be watching for any changes you make and will update live.

# Detailed instructions on using the templates...
...will be written up next week.
